# Outreachy--Integrating-Land-Sector-Data-with-SDGs-EDA
## OVERVIER
This is the first phase of a three part project. The Exploratory Data Analysis phase aims at providing insights to the administrative, climate, Soil, Landcover,and Bioclimatic and Ecological zones in Kenya. 
## INSIGHTS 
Kenya, with an area of 224,081 square miles (580,367 square kilometers), is located at the East side of Africa. From the above analysis, we can draw the following insights:

ADMINISTRATIVE: Kenya has 47 states/counties with the largest being Turkana County, the former Rift Valley Province of Kenya. It is Kenya's largest county by land area of 71,597.8km2 followed by Marsabit County with an area of 66,923.1km2. Mombasa County which is located in the South Eastern part of the Coastal region of Kenya,is the smallest county in Kenya, covering an area of 219.9 Km2 (excluding 65 Km2 of water mass), yet Mombasa County has the fourth highest average contribution to Gross Domestic Product (GDP) in Kenya at 4.7%. Kenya also has an extensive road coverage, both in the rural and urban areas. However, most roads are concentrated in the urban areas.

BIOCLIMATIC AND ECOLOGICAL ZONES: More than half of the country is covered by Tropical scrubland, where the annual precipitation is seasonal to monsoonal and typically varies from 50-150 cm. Here, the main vegetations are scrubs and herbs. Other ecological zones are  Tropical dry forest, Tropical moist forest, Tropical mountain system, Tropical rainforest and Water. The country has the following agroecological zones: Tropical-Humid, Temperate-Dry Semi-Arid, Temperate-Dry Semi-Arid, Tropical-Humid, Temperate-Dry Semi-Arid, Temperate-Moist Semi-Arid,Tropical-Arid, Temperate-Moist Semi-Arid, Tropical-Arid, Tropical-Humid (year round), Tropical Sub-Humid, Boreal-Arid,Borel-Dry Semi-Arid, Boreal-Humid and Boreal-Humid(year round)

LAND COVER: The main plants in Kenya are Tree crops. Less information was found concerning this variables. 

SOIL: The main soil type in the Kenya is  Lixisol and Calcisol. Others are Ferralsol, Leptosol, Nitisol, Vertisol and Waterbodies
